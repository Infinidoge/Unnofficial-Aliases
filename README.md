# Unnofficial-Aliases
This repository is not affiliated with the Arvae Developer Server. Any questions regarding these aliases would go to me, RiptideMatt (Aka Matthew.Thanks(Zonran) on the dev server) if my tag is in the footer, or whoever else is in the footer.

This is where aliases for the Avrae DND Bot that I (or others on the server I'm on) make will be stored. Mostly this will include stuff for unnofficial content that would be difficult to find elsewhere.
